# Classify
There are thousands if not hundreds of thousands of classical music pieces available, but everyone has their favorite pieces. This website will allow users to add songs to a playlist to create a list of their favorite songs. Because there are so many songs, users will be able to search by name or by the artist(s). Users will be able to have multiple playlists and update them (add or remove songs) or delete them. Each user will be able to have one unique username and password to log in and customize their playlists. All users' playlists will be public and viewable on the website so people can see what everyone has in their playlist.  The database will contain the data for all the songs, artists, users, playlists, and their associations. The website will display this information to the user. We will use React for the front-end, Node.JS for the backend and MariaDB for the database. Users will be able to choose from a list of 1000 songs.
